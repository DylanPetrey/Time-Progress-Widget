# Time Progress Widget

## Description
I created this widget during the Spring 2022 semester of college. I had just received an iPad for my Birthday and I wanted a way to easily track how much time was left in the semester. I found an app called Scriptable that would allow you to create custom widgets using JavaScript. This widget displays the current progress of the day, week, month, and semester.
